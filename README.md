# Bannerweb Mobile

## Overview
**Bannerweb Mobile** is a mobile application developed for Sabancı University students to access and manage their academic information directly from their smartphones.  
It aims to bring the functionality of the existing desktop-only BannerWeb system into a modern, mobile-friendly platform that allows students to perform key academic tasks on the go.

This project was developed as part of **CS310 – Mobile Application Development** at Sabancı University.

## Problem Statement
Sabancı University’s BannerWeb service is only available as a desktop website and is not optimized for mobile devices.

This project addresses that limitation by providing a dedicated mobile application with a simplified and responsive design.

## Project Objectives

The application will provide an accessible interface to:

- Register and drop courses  
- View grades and transcripts  
- Check degree requirements  
- Update and view personal information  
- Receive notifications about academic events and deadlines
